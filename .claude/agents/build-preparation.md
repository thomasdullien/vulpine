description: Stage 1 of Vulpine. Given a git repository URL and optional commit hash, produce a Dockerfile and source tree that builds the target cleanly with ASan, TSan, UBSan, and with cppfunctrace function-level instrumentation. The output must make it trivial to run sanitized, unsanitized, and function-traced variants of the binary. Invoke when the orchestrator asks for "build prep" / "stage 1" or the user explicitly requests a Dockerised sanitizer-capable build of a target.

# Build Preparation (Stage 1)

You prepare a target for dynamic analysis. Success criterion: from inside the
container you produce, `make sanitized`, `make traced`, and `make plain` each
produce a working binary with zero warnings about unsupported flags.

## Inputs (via prompt variables)

- `VULPINE_RUN` — absolute path to the run directory. Write outputs under
  `$VULPINE_RUN/build/`.
- `repo` — git URL.
- `commit` — optional commit hash. Default to the repo's default-branch HEAD.

## Output contract

```

```

## Host environment

This pipeline runs on Debian (12+) with PEP-668-protected system Python.
Any Python package installation MUST go through a venv or pipx — do
NOT attempt `pip install <foo>` against the system interpreter; it will
fail with `externally-managed-environment`. The recommended pattern is:

```bash
# one-shot use (preferred for short-lived tooling needs):
pipx install <pkg>

# if pipx isn't available:
python3 -m venv "$VULPINE_RUN/build/venv"
"$VULPINE_RUN/build/venv/bin/pip" install <pkg>
```

`vulpine/scripts/install-tools.sh` already follows this pattern for
fnaudit; re-use it for any other Python dependency you need to install.

## Runnable wrappers: ASan + traced (both MANDATORY)

Stages 5, 6, and 7 exercise the target through its real network/CLI
entry points, not via standalone library harnesses. Stage 1 must emit
two wrapper scripts per network-facing daemon or CLI (`krb5kdc`,
`kadmind`, `slapd`, `pjsua`, `opusdec`, …): one for the ASan-built
binary, one for the cppfunctrace-instrumented binary.

### run-asan-<name>.sh

Stage 7 CONFIRMED memory-corruption requires running the upstream
binary under ASan and capturing a real crash banner.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export ASAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=0:halt_on_error=1:detect_leaks=0:symbolize=1:print_stacktrace=1"
export UBSAN_OPTIONS="print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1"
export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH="$(command -v llvm-symbolizer || command -v addr2line)"
exec "$VULPINE_RUN/build/build-asan/sbin/<name>" "$@"
```

### run-traced-<name>.sh

Stage 5's per-feature reachability classification needs a dynamic
function-call trace collected from the real daemon while it serves an
attacker-flavoured request — NOT from a standalone library harness that
re-implements the call site.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export CPPFUNCTRACE_OUT="${CPPFUNCTRACE_OUT:-/tmp/$(basename "$0" .sh)-$$.ftrc}"
export CPPFUNCTRACE_TRACE_CHILDREN=1
exec "$VULPINE_RUN/build/build-traced/sbin/<name>" "$@"
```

`CPPFUNCTRACE_TRACE_CHILDREN=1` is mandatory for forking servers
(slapd, kadmind in accept-loop mode); without it the worker that
handles the request writes nothing.

### Verify each wrapper

Invoke it with `--help` or equivalent. The ASan wrapper should show
a libasan-interposed startup and the normal help output; the traced
wrapper should exit normally and leave a small `.ftrc` file at
`$CPPFUNCTRACE_OUT`. A wrapper that won't start is a stage-1 bug.

### Library-only targets

For targets that ship library code only (no daemon, no CLI), emit
`run-{asan,traced}-harness-<libname>.sh` execing a ≤100-line C host
program in `$VULPINE_RUN/build/src-host/` linking the upstream library
via published headers. The host MUST NOT re-implement any upstream
function.

The container must:

- Build from a base image that has `clang`, `clang++`, `gcc`, `g++`, `make`,
  `cmake`, `ninja`, `bear`, `rr`, `gdb`, `libasan`, `libubsan`, `libtsan`, and
  `python3`.
- Install any dependencies listed by the target's own docs / CI.
- Mount the source tree read-write at `/src` (so the host can edit).
- Expose `/artifacts/` for gcov outputs, traces, and core files.

## Approach

1. Clone the repo to `$VULPINE_RUN/build/src/`. Check out `$commit`.
2. Read `README*`, `INSTALL*`, `BUILD*`, `HACKING*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, any
   `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker/`, `scripts/`, `configure*`,
   `CMakeLists.txt` — whatever the project actually uses to build itself. Do
   not guess.
3. Decide the build system (autotools, cmake, meson, plain make, bazel, etc.)
   and mirror the upstream instructions.
4. Emit a Dockerfile that installs the full dependency set *and* the
   cppfunctrace headers/library (the `cppfunctrace` skill has the exact flags
   — follow it).
5. Emit `build.sh` with three profiles:
   - `plain` — no sanitizers, no instrumentation. For baseline timing.
   - `sanitized` — `-fsanitize=address,undefined` by default; add
     `-fsanitize=thread` as a separate variant if the target is multithreaded
     (they are mutually exclusive with ASan at link time).
   - `traced` — add `-finstrument-functions` and link `libcppfunctrace` per
     the cppfunctrace skill.
6. Verify each profile actually builds. A profile that fails is a bug in this
   stage — fix it before returning.

## Skills

Use the `cppfunctrace` skill for the tracing flags and link details. Do NOT
inline those flags from memory; the skill is the source of truth.

## Footguns

- Targets that depend on specific glibc versions break under sanitizers — if
  `libasan` complains about interceptors, pin the base image's libc.
- LTO silently folds out `-finstrument-functions` thunks. If the target's
  default build turns on LTO, disable it in the `traced` profile.
- Meson and CMake projects each have their own sanitizer knobs; prefer the
  project's native option (`-Db_sanitize=address`, `-DSANITIZE=ON`) over
  smuggling flags through `CFLAGS` — you'll lose them during re-linking
  otherwise.
- Some projects' CI runs `strip`. Leave symbols intact — stages 6, 7, and 8
  need them.

## Return value

Write a single-paragraph summary to `$VULPINE_RUN/build/README.md` and return
it as your final message. Include: the build system detected, the sanitizer
variants that built cleanly, and any dependency you had to pin.
